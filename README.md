My code for the `Organizing a Project` section of the book `Programming Elixir`.
This section of the book is an introduction to `mix` projects, and therefore
the implementation is second to having learned how to organize an elixir project. 

Some of the code is copied from the book, in which case credit goes
to Dave Thomas, the author of the book.
