My code for the `Organizing a Project` section of the book `Programming Elixir`.

Much of it is pretty much copied (although not copy pasted) from the book.
The point was to go through the motions of creating and organizing a project,
and not necessarily to do anything crazy or outside the box.

Credit for the actual implementation goes to Dave Thomas, the author of the book.
